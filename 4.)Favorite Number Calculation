//4.)Favorite Number Calculation:

// Step 1: Declare a variable to hold the favorite number
let theFavNumber = 7; // You can change this number to whatever the favorite number is

// Step 2: Use a while loop to repeatedly ask the user for their guess
let userGuess; // Variable to store the user's guess

// Continue looping until the user guesses the correct number
while (userGuess !== theFavNumber) {
    // Step 3: Prompt the user to guess their favorite number
    userGuess = parseInt(prompt("Guess my favorite number:")); // Convert input to an integer

    // Step 4: Check if the guess is too high, too low, or correct
    if (userGuess > theFavNumber) {
        console.log("Too high! Try again."); // Log if the guess is too high
    } else if (userGuess < theFavNumber) {
        console.log("Too low! Try again."); // Log if the guess is too low
    } else {
        console.log("Correct! You've guessed the number!"); // Log if the guess is correct
    }
}
